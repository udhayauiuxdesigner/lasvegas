The event was filled with celebrities and entertainment but had a successful ending with Verstappen's victory and praise for the track. Despite some issues during practice, the race was considered one of the most lively of the season. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez also had a strong race finishing second and third, respectively. A drain cover on the track drew the most attention by damaging Carlos Sainz's car severely in Free Practice 1 - resulting in a major delay and a 10-second penalty to Sainz for the damages that had to be fixed (stupid I know).
