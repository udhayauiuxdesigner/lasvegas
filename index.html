<h5>FORMULA 1 LATE NIGHT PRACTICE, DRAIN COVERS, AND YET ANOTHER MAX VERSTAPPEN WIN IN LAS VEGAS!</h5>
<p><b>Max Verstappen won the Las Vegas Grand Prix after initially disliking the excess and opulence of the event.</b> The event was filled with celebrities and entertainment but had a successful ending with Verstappen's victory and praise for the track. Despite some issues during practice, the race was considered one of the most lively of the season. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez also had a strong race finishing second and third, respectively. A drain cover on the track drew the most attention by damaging Carlos Sainz's car severely in Free Practice 1 - resulting in a major delay and a 10-second penalty to Sainz for the damages that had to be fixed (stupid I know)
<br> <br>Next up: The finale of the 2023 season at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday!</p>
<h5>WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LSU TIGERS STAR ANGEL REESE INVOLVED IN OFF-COURT DRAMA!</h5>
<p>Something is going on behind the scenes with LSU women's basketball star Angel Reese. Kim Mulkey, LSU women's basketball coach, refused to discuss the absence of Angel Reese - who was not with the team for a recent game. Reese's absence follows her being benched in the previous game and Mulkey said it was "a coach's decision." Despite this, the team has a strong lineup and is expected to compete for a second consecutive national title.</p>
<h5>NBA: SUNS WILL BE WITHOUT GUARD BRADLEY FOR A FEW WEEKS</h5>
<p>Bradley Beal will be out for at least three weeks due to a back injury, impacting the Phoenix Suns' plan to create a powerful trio with him and Devin Booker. The team will reevaluate his condition in three weeks. The Suns are 7-6 after a dramatic win over the Utah Jazz last night.</p>

<h5>Storylines</h5>

<p><b>Josh Allen and the Bills got back on track against the Jets on Sunday</b>. Buffalo won 32-6. Allen had a strong performance, throwing for 275 yards and 3 touchdowns. The defense did a stellar job shutting down New York. With the win, the Bills are sitting at 6-5 and in the thick of the AFC playoff race.</p>
<p><b>The Lions pulled off a tremendous comeback to beat the Bears 31-26.</b> Detroit outscored Chicago 17-6 in the 4th quarter. Jared Goff had a tough day, throwing 3 interceptions, but he turned it on late and played his best when it mattered most. The Lions are now 8-2 and in firm control of the NFC North.</p>
<p><b>Brock Purdy had himself a day against the Tampa Bay defense. Purdy went 21/25 with 333 yards and 3 touchdowns.</b> The 49ers beat the Buccaneers 27-14. San Francisco went through some struggles a couple of weeks ago but they are back to being their dominant self. The 49ers are 7-3 and in first place in the NFC West.</p>
