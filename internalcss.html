<h5>FORMULA 1: LATE NIGHT PRACTICE, DRAIN COVERS, AND YET ANOTHER MAX VERSTAPPEN WIN IN LAS VEGAS!</h5>
<p style='font-family: "Work Sans", sans-serif; font-size:1.0rem;'>Max Verstappen won the Las Vegas Grand Prix after initially disliking the excess and opulence of the event. The event was filled with celebrities and entertainment but had a successful ending with Verstappen's victory and praise for the track. Despite some issues during practice, the race was considered one of the most lively of the season. Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc and Verstappen's teammate Sergio Perez also had a strong race finishing second and third, respectively. A drain cover on the track drew the most attention by damaging Carlos Sainz's car severely in Free Practice 1 - resulting in a major delay and a 10-second penalty to Sainz for the damages that had to be fixed (stupid I know).

Next up: The finale of the 2023 season at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday!</p>
<h5>WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LSU TIGERS STAR ANGEL REESE INVOLVED IN OFF-COURT DRAMA!</h5>

Reese's absence follows her being benched in the previous game and Mulkey said it was "a coach's decision." Despite this, the team has a strong lineup and is expected to compete for a second consecutive national title.</p>
